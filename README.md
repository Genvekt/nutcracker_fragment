# Nutcracker fragment | Words to Python
Here is my interpretation of real fragment from the "NutCracker" fairytale translated
into Python code. The activity was organised by [MTS](https://hr.mts.ru/word2code) at the beginning of 2023.

In the files you can find code, as well as text versions in Russian and English languages.
