So it was. The greedy mouse king, having eaten the sweets, left only marzipan, not finding it,
probably to his liking, but nevertheless he gnawed it so much that the rest had to be thrown away
anyway. Good Marie not only did not spare sweets, but in her heart she even rejoiced that she had
thus saved her Nutcracker. But what did she feel when the next night she again heard the familiar,
piercing whistle near her pillow! The mouse king sat again on the table, and, his eyes sparkling even
more disgustingly than on the previous night, he squeaked through his teeth:

“Give me back your sugar and gingerbread dolls, or I'll bite your Nutcracker in half!” I'll rip it, I'll rip it!

Having said this, he again disappeared under the floor.

Marie was very upset when, going to the cupboard the next day, she saw her sugar and gingerbread dolls.
Her grief was completely understandable, because it is unlikely that you, my little listener Marie,
have ever seen such lovely sugar and gingerbread dolls as Marie Stahlbaum had. There was a shepherd
and a shepherd and a whole herd of snow-white lambs, and a dog jumping merrily around them, there
were two postmen with letters, and besides, four pairs of beautifully dressed boys and girls dancing a
Russian dance; there was Pachter Feldkümmel with the Virgin of Orleans, who, however, did not particularly
please Masha; she loved the little, ruddy-cheeked child in the cradle more than anyone.
